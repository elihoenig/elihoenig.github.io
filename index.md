# Eli Hoenig
Materials scientist & experimental physicist  
I build nanoscale devices to explore ion transport and charge transfer in 2D materials.

## Research {#projects}
A brief overview of my current research directions:

- Dual-ionic gating and quantum capacitance
- Ion intercalation in 2D materials (MoS₂, graphene, hBN)
- Suspended membrane devices on SiN apertures
- Nanoscale electrochemistry with redox-active electrolytes
- Cleanroom nanofabrication and advanced characterization
