# Eli Hoenig
I am a materials scientist and experimental physicist working on nanoscale electrochemistry, 2D materials, and ionic gating.

## Current focus
- Dual-ionic gating & quantum capacitance
- Ion intercalation in 2D materials (MoS₂, graphene, hBN)
- Suspended membrane devices on SiN apertures
