    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo in the Condensed Matter Physics Group at the University of Manchester. 
    I did my graduate work with Chong Liu at the University of Chicago. My research is on ion transport and charge transfer in two-dimensional material systems.

## Research focus
I study how the tunable electronic and structural properties of nanomaterials shape their interactions with liquids, ions, and redox-active molecules. Much of my work centers on two-dimensional materials (graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride) which span the full range of electronic behavior from metals to semiconductors to insulators. By stacking, functionalizing, and electrostatically gating these materials, I design devices that serve as both scientific probes and engineering platforms. My approach is pluralistic: I engineer devices for specific applications, design experiments with well-defined scientific hypotheses, and (often most fruitfully) pursue interesting physical phenomena when they happen to emerge.
