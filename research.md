## Electrochemistry with ionically-gated 2D materials 
This is a currently active area of research. Based on [recent advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19505) in the Lozada-Hidalgo group, we can ask new questions of electrochemical systems. How does band structure (tunable with large electric fields) affect charge transfer from 2D electrode to reactant? How does carrier density and electric field affect ion transport within the interlayer gallery of 2D materials? We aim to answer these questions with an eye towards new energy storage systems and ion-based computing applications.

## Ion selective nanopores

    <p>
     By electrochemically sculpting sub-nanometer pores directly into few-layer MoS₂, we created atomically thin membranes that act as precise ionic sieves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52109-8" target="_blank">Nature Comms, 2024</a>. These pores are small enough to discriminate between hydrated ions based on size and coordination, yet large enough to sustain measurable transport. Because the MoS₂ lattice is robust, the pores remain structurally well-defined, allowing us to probe ion dehydration and confinement at the atomic limit. Using a combination of ionic conductance measurements, STEM imaging, and molecular simulations, we mapped how pore geometry and charge shape transport, enabling a quantitative link between atomic-scale defects and ion selectivity.

## Macrosopic filtration membranes from 2D sheets

<div class="research-block">
  <div class="research-text">
    <p>
      Practical membranes for water filtration must be robust and flexible. 
By exfoliating 2D crystals in the liquid phase then allowing the sheets to self-assemble, I made a layered, macroscopic membrane with highly tunable microscopic properties <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02114" target="_blank">Nano Letters, 2020 </a>. Due to their weak van-der-waals interactions, the sheets can slide, rotate and bend without causing the membrane to fracture (see image). We controlled the structure of this membrane on the angstrom-scale using chemical functionalization and characterized it's water filtration performance with liter-scale volumes. Molecular dynamics simulations, x-ray, electron-microscope (see images) and optical techniques were critical in understanding its structure-property relationships. This work led to multiple collaborations, in which we investigated lanthanide tranpsort <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adh1330" target="_blank">Science Advances, 2024 </a> and ion-ion interactions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61307-x" target="_blank">Nature Comms, 2025 </a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2313616121" target="_blank">PNAS, 2024 </a> in these membranes.

## Early work in atomic and optical physics (NIST & Williams College)
Before moving into 2D materials and nanoscale electrochemistry, I worked in atomic and optical physics, developing experimental systems for precision spectroscopy and frequency-comb measurements. At Williams, I investigated the atomic structure of heavy metal elements using precision spectroscopy. I built a free-space optical apparatus for faraday rotation measurements of weak electronic transitions in atomic Pb (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.052506" target="_blank">Phys. Rev. A, 2019</a>) and carried out the first round of measurements and analysis. 
At NIST, I  constructed a fiber-based optical amplifier for frequency-comb experiments and performed the associated measurements (<a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-27-8-11869" target="_blank">Optics Express, 2019</a>). I also developed drone-based data-acquisition software for environmental sensing fieldwork integrated with dual-comb spectrometers (<a href="https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ES-2020-EM3C.2" target="_blank">OSA Sensing, 2020</a>).
