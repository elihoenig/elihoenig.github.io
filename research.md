# Research

Below is a brief overview of my main research directions.

---

## Dual-Ionic Gating & Quantum Capacitance
I develop dual-gated 2D heterostructures (graphene, MoS₂, hBN) where carrier density and out-of-plane electric field can be tuned independently. These structures allow precise measurement of quantum capacitance, electrochemical potentials, and field-dependent band structure.

## Ion Intercalation in 2D Materials
Using suspended or encapsulated heterostructures, I study how Li⁺ and other ions intercalate into 2D materials, enabling control of:
- intercalation thermodynamics
- kinetics and barriers
- device-level hysteresis
- reversible ionic memory states (10²–10³ ON/OFF)

---

## Suspended Membrane Devices
I fabricate crack-free, wrinkle-free suspended 2D membranes over SiN apertures (5–10 μm). These structures enable:
- true nanoscale electrochemistry
- precise ionic transport
- Faradaic reactions with minimal parasitic processes

---

## Redox Electrochemistry (Fc/Fc⁺ and functionalized derivatives)
I use redox-active ionic liquids and ferrocene derivatives to probe:
- overpotentials
- reaction onset
- hysteresis formation
- field-induced effects on redox states

---

## Methods & Skills
- Cleanroom nanofabrication (EBL, lift-off, oxide etching, transfer)
- AFM, Raman, PL mapping
- Keithley SMUs, Zurich Instruments, QCoDeS
- Device process design & automation
